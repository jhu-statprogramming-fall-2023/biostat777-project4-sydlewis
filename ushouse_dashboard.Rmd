# About

## Column {data-width=400}

### Research Question: **How has the volume and distribution of votes changed in U.S. House of Representative elections over time?**

I am interested in how the amount of votes have changed over time and how these numbers differ across midterm and presidential election years. I am also interested in how the proportion of elections won has changed over time across party. 

### Data Source

In answering these questions I using data from the [MIT Election Data and Science Lab](https://electionlab.mit.edu). I downloaded the dataset via the Tidy Tuesday GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-11-07/readme.md). The data dictionary can also be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-11-07/readme.md).

# The Data

### Description {data-height=200}

Each row of the data set represents a candidate in a United States House of Representatives Election. The row contains information about the election, including the year, state, and type (primary or general), about the candidate, including their name and party, and about the election results, including the number of votes cast for the candidate and the total number of votes in the election. 

### Dataset {data-height=800}

```{r}
# Function created to avoid unnecessarily saving the data when it is already saved locally

download_and_save <- function(file_name, url) {
  data_folder <- "../data"
  file_path <- file.path("../data", file_name)
  # See if the file already exists
  if (!file.exists("../data")) {
    dir.create("../data", recursive = TRUE)
  }
  if (!file.exists(file_path)) {
    # Download the data if it does not exist
    data <- readr::read_csv(url)
    # Save the data to the path with the desired name
    write.csv(data, file = file_path, row.names = FALSE)
  }
}

# Analysis

## Column {data-width=350}

### Results Summary

Over this entire time period, there are more votes in Presidential Election years than in Midterm Election years. The difference in the amount of votes received by Democrats and Republicans is dependent on the election year. 

The percentage of election wins for Republicans and Democrats varies by election year. Before 1994, Democrats had a more consistent majority in the House compared to recent years.

The Democrats have more years when they have won more elections that Republicans. In more recent years, the difference in the amount of wins between the two parties has been narrower than in earlier years. 

### Functions Used

`dplyr`: `group_by`, `mutate`, `case_when`, `summarise`, `filter`, `ungroup`, `across`

`ggplot2`: `geom_point`, `geom_line`, `geom_errorbar`, `geom_col`, `geom_text`, `labs`, `scale_color_manual`, `theme`

`tidyr` : `spread`, `unnest_wider`
