# biostat777-project4-sydlewis

My name is Sydney Lewis and I created a dashboard using U.S. House Elections data from Tidy Tuesday. This project was part of an assignment for my Statistical Programming Paradigms and Workflows class at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Please find the deployed dashboard [here](https://sydlewis.shinyapps.io/biostat777-project4-sydlewis/)
